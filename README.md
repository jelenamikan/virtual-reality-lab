## Lab 2
Creating a start and end menu with Play, Options and Quit buttons. The button is clicked with focusing the player's look to the button for 2 seconds.

## Lab 3
Creating interaction with the objects: grabbing the pick axe, destroying the wooden box and collecting golden treasures from the box. The interaction is achieved with clicking on the objects, so a controller is needed to play.
